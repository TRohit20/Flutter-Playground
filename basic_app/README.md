# basic_app

A Flutter project built in the process of learning where this app has all the basics and fundamentals covered.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for Flutter.

- The project is not the best or most beautiful app out there but it is a implementation of my learnings to get a clear understanding first. 

- I recommend you to go through the [notes provided here](https://github.com/TRohit20/Flutter-Playground/tree/main/Learning%20Material) 
- Simultaneously, look at the code and implementation for better understanding.

- It would be even better if you implemented things by yourself. You can [get started here](https://rohitlogs.com/from-zero-to-flutter-setting-up-your-development-environment-and-first-app)
