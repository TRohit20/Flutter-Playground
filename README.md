# Tools and Environment
Personally, I use MacoS. Git, Xcode, Android Studio are essentials in order to install flutter on your system and prepare the environment. 
The process can be little different. So I suggest following the following documentation of flutter [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos). Follow it step-by-step.
Or, you can follow [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/JJwBoRMY08U) on youtube too. 

I use Visual Studio Code for my Flutter development. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
If you are using VS Code as your IDE, Make sure you download the extension "Flutter"


After you finish setting up the environment and all essentials. Just make sure to re-check if you have done everything required right. 
You can do that simply by entering this command in the terminal
```
flutter doctor
```

To create a Flutter project, use this command:
```
flutter create project_name
```

Before you run a project, make sure you have a target simulator running be it IOS or Android:
For IOS, use the below command to directly launch the IOS simulator:
```
open -a Simulator
```

For Android, you can Launch the simulator by using the Android Studio

You can run the flutter project using the command:
```
flutter run. // Running the application for the first time, it needs to compile the code to native and run it, so it will take time. Be patient 
```

# Alternatives to Flutter to better assess your fit
It is important to understand that flutter is not the only solution for cross-platform development. There are other tools too, so I look at the alternatives too and decide which is better for you. 
You can read this article here for a better understanding: ["React Native vs Flutter vs Ionic vs NativeScript vs PWA"](https://academind.com/tutorials/react-native-vs-flutter-vs-ionic-vs-nativescript-vs-pwa)
