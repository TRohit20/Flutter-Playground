# Flutter-Playground
This is a repository that keeps track of all my learnings of flutter from resources to my demo projects.

# Tools and Environment
Personally, I use MacoS. Git, Xcode, Android Studio are essentials in order to install flutter on your system and prepare the environment. 
The process can be little different. So I suggest following the following documentation of flutter [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos). Follow it step-by-step.
Or, you can follow [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/JJwBoRMY08U) on youtube too. 

After you finish setting up the environment and all essentials. Just make sure to re-check if you have done everything required right. 
You can do that simply by entering this command in the terminal
```
flutter doctor
```
