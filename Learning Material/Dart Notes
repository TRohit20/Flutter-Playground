Dart is a Object oriented programming language. 
It is the base programming language used to build in flutter.

Each language has their own set of keywords. These are speacial words reserved by the language which are used to do certain function. You can make it understand what you wanna do using them.

Data types are the types of data that are to be stored such as integers, characters etc. 

Constants are usually values which cannot be changed or vary. Compile time or run-time, constants value doesnt change. 

Functions are piece of code that hold your logic so you dont have to write it again and again.

Dart is a lot similar to Java and javascript. If you have experience with them like I do, it just gets easier to learn. BUT IT IS NOT MANDATORY!

Dart Control Statements and Collections:
If and else are conditional statements used in Dart. Meaning these are keywords used to assert a condition like if the condition is true, it'll execute the body. They are a control statement.
You can have multiple if statements or else if statements too. 

Dart executes line by line. Please keep it in mind as you decide your layout and code hierachy.

Operators are usually of three types: Prefix, postfix and suffix. (refer to code examples).
You can also create your own operators or overide operators using classes and objects. We will dive into it in some while.

It is useful to know that dart is a language that has certain exceptions written.

Lists in dart:
A data structure that stores similar data i.e homogenous data. Data of the same type. 
You can initalise them using the square brackets.
It is also very important to know that the indexes of lists in dart or pretty much all programming languages start with 0 and not 1!
Lists also have a range of methods or functions available such as length of list etc
*** 
But how do you extract those methods? You use '.'
'.' is used to draw the methods or functions available, to access a object or property etc.

Sets in Dart:
it is a list of unique things meaning a data structure that can store and hold data of different types such as strings, integer etc.
It is initialised using flower brackets '{}'
Set allows you to create a unique set of list.

Maps in Dart:
Maps are data structures that are used to hold key-value pairs of information similar to dictionaries in python(Pretty much same).
Let us say you are storing a human's data such as age, name, gender, height etc
The above are keys(properties of a human). Now, they have values right? Hence the key-value pair.
key inside a map need to be unique.
You initialise a map using flower brackets but in this way: 
** ref_var = {'property_name':'value','property_name':'value'};

***** NULL SAFETY: Very important topic in Dart, Swift and Rust and other languages!
In programming language we are allowed to have the absence of a value. For example you have a variable, you can tell that this variable can either store a certain data or for its lifetime be nothing(No value).
That right there, having no value or nothing is called Null.
It is a keyword used to indicate the absence of a value.

In Dart, this is called Sound Null safety.
You can make any type nullable by using a questionmark after the datatype like this:
EG: String? ref_var = null;
A good example with explanation in code in test.dart file
