### Notes made while building the Recipes App

* Every widget can essentially be used as screen/route/page. It's all the same.
    It is just a term used to describe a entire page on the app

* Home argument in Main dart file is used to make a certain screen as a main screen or the entry point of the app. 

* MaterialPageRoute is like a wrapper we need to handle animations or transition from one page to another or more

- We used Navigator and Pageroute widgets to make navigation between pages possible
